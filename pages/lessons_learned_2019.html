                            <p class="description">Our freshman year is complete! We built a whole robot our selves, and were able to compete on the state tournament level. We hope that next year we do just as well and that we make it to nationals next year!</p>

                                Our first year with FRC showed us what we should expect for next year. We made lots of mistakes that we get to learn from and wil have these issues fixed for next year.
                                For example our robot was way to heavy because we used 1.5-inch 80/20 material for the elevator. Next year we will slim it down to 1x1 or use aluminum because it was over kill and limited our other options

                                I was on the electrical team and we have a lot of improving to do on the robot. I would make the electrical board more accesible instead of under the robot so we can fix it or make repairs as need be, I would also like to improve the electrical connectors to make the system neater and more visually appealing

                                We need to recruit more team members, especially girls since we strive to be as open and welcoming to any student that is wanting to participate in any way. we need skills in areas other than the robot such as graphic design and business planning such as fundraising.

                                I personally learned the importance of teamwork. I learned that if not everybody is working equally as hard the job wont get done. I also learned alot about electical and pneumatics. I didnt even know how a light bulb turned on before the season started; but now i, I can wire the robot.

                                This year I learned a lot about 80/20 aluminum and how to construct objects like the elevator using it. We used 1.5 inch material this year. Its very sturdy but it is also very heavy. We were not able to add other features to the robot due to our weight. I would use lighter material and focus on manipulating game pieces inside the robot perimeter and focus on actions that give us ranking points in the game.
