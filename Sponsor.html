                                <b>Please help sponsor a group of growing young engineers! </b>
                            <p>
                                <p>
                                    Despite competing with experienced teams 3 times our size with thousands of dollars in corporate sponsorships, our robot and team has qualified for the First Robotics Michigan State Championships April 10 -13 in Saginaw Michigan! Michigan's First Robotics district has more than 500 teams and so for us to qualify for state in our first year, we have done really well.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    Now comes the hard part. For a new team, First Robotics competition is expensive, especially at the state level. We need to raise $3,100 more  to be able to take our team and robot to Saginaw to compete. 
                                </p>
